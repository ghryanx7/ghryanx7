Hello my friend👋🏻, I am **RYAN_x7** and my real name is **ARSHMA.NAiM-RYAN**.

I am an ESFJ-A personality type. 
I hate proud and lying people and I hate this behavior myself.
I am not very warm and cold person, but I communicate with everyone just like normal people. 

How did I get into coding? Well, my beginning goes back to 2021, in this year I was scrolling through YouTube when I saw a video about Discord, I became very interested in this platform, so I went and created an account. 
To build my Discord server I went back to YouTube and watched a video tutorial for configuring my server. 
While scrolling, I saw a video with the title of making Discord Music Robot.
I was interested in watching it, so I did.
After following the video steps I made a bot for my server. 
It was very exciting for me, then I decided to make more robots and that's what I did. 
Thus, by building several robots and manipulating them with the Javascript coding language, I learned this language without watching any training video, I did this in two months. 

When I learned the Javascript coding language, I was able to create amazing robots. 
I have created a bot for creating tickets in Discord in 2023 called [**Evolution X**]([https://evolution-x.ryanx71.repl.co]), which is very easy to work with it. 
Please help me by inviting it to your discord server and using it. 

Thank you so much for joining my Discord servers so we can talk more: 
[**Development server**](https://dsc.gg/persian-caesar) and [**Community server**](https://discord.gg/GMBFN8bsP9)
